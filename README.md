Access [http://localhost:3000/champions](http://localhost:3000/champions) and press a champion icon to look at the information

TO DOS:

# MAJOR PROBLEMS:

- Math calculations seem extremely wrong.
- Buying items does not modify skill damages
- Inventory.jsx --> tooltip on hover item
- Shop.jsx --> Make item MATH information show up

# MINOR PROBLEMS:

- Buying mana items should not increase the mana for Energy / Fury champions
  - Would be nice to have these champs have "energy / fury" shown up as text instead of "mana"
- Properly make only 1 mythic per inventory and other niche / unique instances
- Make everything look better
- Inventory.jsx --> Ornn border should use current patch border
- Inventory.jsx --> Make sure if the icon does not exist, use a temporary image
